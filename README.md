# A demo of machine translation task based on Transformer

Code startup instructions: After cloning the project, place txt data files for the two languages (source and target languages) in the project folder. 
Ensure each line in the files represents one sentence and that the sentences in both files correspond one-to-one as shown in the example below.

Then, modify the 'src_file_path' and 'tgt_file_path' values in the training_config file to the paths of the respective data files. 
Finally, run the train_translation_task.py file in the main directory of the project to start the process.

Now the distribution training is disable.
